* goggles.el - Pulse modified region

[[https://melpa.org/#/goggles][file:https://melpa.org/packages/goggles-badge.svg]]

Goggles highlights the modified region using =pulse=. Currently the
commands undo, yank, kill and delete are supported.

This library is the holy counterpart of =evil-goggles=. Another
comparable library is =volatile-highlights=, which does not use =pulse=.
By setting =goggle-pulse= to =nil=, the =goggles-mode= behaves
similarily to the =volatile-highlights-mode=.

** Usage

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package goggles
  :hook ((prog-mode . goggles-mode)
         (text-mode . goggles-mode))
  :config
  (setq-default goggles-pulse t)) ;; set to nil to disable pulsing
#+end_src emacs-lisp

** Comparison to volatile-highlights

Goggles is mainly meant as a replacement for volatile-highlights (vhl), which is
very popular, but has a few downsides from my perspective.

- vhl does not support pulse. The request to use pulse for modification
  highlighting has come up a few times (e.g.Â recently on reddit).
- vhl is essentially unmaintained, no commit for 5 years.
- vhl contains obsolete code (cl instead of cl-lib, old advice mechanism,
  untested xemacs support)
- I disagree with the way vhl written, which is unnecessarily
  complicated. For example vhl contains an overly complicated extension
  mechanism. This extension mechanism somehow seems to require unnecessary
  bytecode compilation at startup.

Since improving volatile-highlights does not seem possible to me, except by a
rewrite, I decided to create another package. This way breakage for
volatile-highlights users is avoided.
